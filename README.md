# Stock-Recommendation-System
Helps To Recommend Profitable Stocks


The objective of this recommender system is to support stock 
market traders, individual investors and fund managers in their 
decisions by suggesting investment in a group of equity stocks 
when strong evidence of possible profit from these transactions is 
available.

This is my group's mini project for Third Year Engineering.
